        In English there are three articles: a, an, and the. Articles are used
        before nouns or noun equivalents and are a type of adjective. The
        definite article (the) is used before a noun to indicate that the
        identity of the noun is known to the reader. The indefinite article (a,
        an) is used before a noun that is general or when its identity is not
        known. There are certain situations in which a noun takes no article.
